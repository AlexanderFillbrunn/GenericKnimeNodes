This package provides the source code for the KNIME plugin

            org.ballproject.kime

providing basic functionality for further plugins depending 
on the GenericKnimeNodes mechanism.

The base plugin can be built by issuing

ant buildbaseplugin

which will produce the respective jar file that has to be 
copied into the plugins folder of the KNIME installation.

The NodeGenerator, that creates the source code of further
plugins from the tool description files, can be built by
issuing

ant buildgenerator

which will create the relevant jar file. The NodeGenerator
can then be used to build the source code of new plugins by
adjusting the properties file plugin.properties and executing
the script file

./nodegenerator.sh 

which will the generate the relevant source code.

The final dependent plugin jar can the be built by issuing

ant buildplugin
