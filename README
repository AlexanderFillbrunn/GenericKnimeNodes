This package provides the source code for the KNIME plugin

  org.ballproject.kime

which provides basic functionality for integration of external
(commandline) programs into KNIME. The whole system is named  
GenericKnimeNodes.


-- QuickStart --

Please adjust the file build.properties that the property
knimeSDKpath points to the path of the KNIME SDK root. You can
download the KNIME SDK at http://knime.org/downloads/overview.  

To build your first GKN demo plugin (a BLAST node) simply issue 

  ant deploy -Dknimedir=<path-to-knime-root-dir>

where <path-to-knime-root-dir> points to the directoy containing 
your KNIME installation. This will generate the GKN base plugin
and the BLAST plugin and copy them into the plugins folder of your
KNIME installation. You should (re)start KNIME now and see the 
BLAST plugin as a new available node within the community section
of KNIME.

The plugin properties, like name, version, pointers to node config
files (ctd) are given in the plugin.properties file and link most
of the time to the demo folder. You should have a detailed look at
the demo folder files for more information about how to configure
GKN node generation.

BLAST is a simple command line tool to execute efficient DNA/protein 
sequence searches against a database of sequences (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).


-- Further information --


The deploy target automatically executes the targets mentioned
below:

# Base plugin #
The base plugin can then be built by issuing

ant buildbaseplugin

which will produce the respective jar file 

  org.ballproject.knime_x.y.z.jar
 
in the build directory that has to be  copied into the plugins
folder of the KNIME installation.

# Your plugin #
The NodeGenerator, that creates the source code of further
plugins from the tool description files (ctd), can be built
by issuing

ant nodegen

which will create the relevant jar file in the build directory 
based on the properties set in the file plugin.properties.

Along with the tool descriptor files a mimetypes.xml is needed
that defines all used mimetypes. This file has to reside in the
directory defined via the property 'descriptordir' in the 
plugin.properties file. See demo/blast/descriptors for a simple
mimetypes.xml.

If you use GKN 'internal' programs you have to supply the 
corresponding executables for each program. These wrapped 
binaries have to be supplied in a payload directory
specified by the respective property in the plugin.properties
file (payloaddir). Pleaser refer to payload.README for further
details. If you create a plugin containing only external programs
(i.e. programs already located on your system) you do not need
to supply any payload data. The user can use the GKN preference
tab to set the pathes to the tools located on the target system.

Finally, you should copy the resulting two jar files

- org.ballproject.knime_x.y.z.jar
- orf.mydomain.myplugin_a.b.c.jar

into the plugins folder of KNIME (done automatically by deploy
target).
