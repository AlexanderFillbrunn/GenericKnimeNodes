This package provides the source code for the KNIME plugin

  org.ballproject.kime

providing basic functionality for further plugins depending 
on the GenericKnimeNodes mechanism.

Please adjust the file build.properties and make the property
knimeSDKpath point to the path of the KNIME SDK root. You can
download the KNIME SDK at http://knime.org/downloads/overview.  

Creating your personal KNIME nodes is as easy as typing "ant"!

1. Switch to you GenericKnimeNodes directory
2. Call "ant"
   This generates the needed base plugin and the sample
   plugin in a directory called build right in your current
   working directory.
3. Copy the two plugins in the plugins directory of your
   KNIME installation (standard of SDK) and your ready
   to start KNIME.
4. Enjoy!

If you want to build your KNIME nodes from another directory
just call:

   ant -Dplugin.dir=[your_path]

Do not forget to replace [your_path] with a valid directory.
e.g.

   ant -Dplugin.dir=/home/jon.doe/my_plugin_sources
   (without trailing slash!)

The two resulting plugins always reside in a directory
called "build".
e.g.

   /home/jone.doe/build

which will produce the respective jar file 

  org.ballproject.knime_x.y.z.jar
 

The following directory structure must be provided within
the specified directory:

your
plugin
directory
  │
  ├── plugin.properties
  │
  ├── descriptors (place your ctd files and mimetypes.xml here)
  │
  ├── payload (place your binaries here)
  │
  └── icons (the icons to be used must be here)

See the sample directory of your GenericKnimeNodes directory
for an example.

If you use GKN 'internal' programs you have to supply the 
corresponding executables for each program. These wrapped 
binaries have to be supplied in the payload directory
Pleaser refer to payload.README for further details.

If you create a plugin containing only external programs
(i.e. programs already located on your system) you do not need
to supply any payload data. The user can use the GKN preference
tab to set the paths to the tools located on the target system.
