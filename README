This package provides the source code for the KNIME plugin

  org.ballproject.kime

providing basic functionality for further plugins depending 
on the GenericKnimeNodes mechanism.

The base plugin can be built by issuing

ant buildbaseplugin

which will produce the respective jar file 

  org.ballproject.knime_x.y.z.jar
 
in the build directory that has to be  copied into the plugins
folder of the KNIME installation.

The NodeGenerator, that creates the source code of further
plugins from the tool description files, can be built by
issuing

ant nodegen

which will create the relevant jar file in the build directory 
based on the properties set in the file plugin.properties.

Along with the tool descriptor files a mimetypes.xml is needed
that defines all used mimetypes.

The wrapped binaries have to be supplied in a payload directory
specified by the respective property in the plugin.properties
file. Pleaser refer to payload.README for further details.

Finally, you should copy the resulting two jar file into the 
plugins folder of KNIME.
