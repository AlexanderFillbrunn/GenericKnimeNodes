        <intro>
        	When processing files in parallel on a cluster KNIME expects the results to be a table that is concatenated locally.
        	To send files from a cluster node back to the client they must be put into a table with cells that contain a reference to a file.
        	Once the table is sent back to the client, the file is taken along.
